# UCD Autumn Data Programming With R

Welcome to my GitHub repository for the "Data Programming with R" module, taken during the Autumn trimester. This repository contains all my coursework, including assignments and the final project for this course.

## Assignments Overview

Each assignment, including the final project, is designed to enhance my proficiency with R, focusing on data manipulation, analysis, and visualization techniques.

### Quarto Task
The Quarto Task involves creating a reproducible report using Quarto to render R code and outputs neatly.

- **Files**:
  - `Quarto_Task.qmd`: Quarto markdown file containing the R code.
  - `Quarto_Task.html`: Rendered HTML output showing all code and results.

For detailed tasks and outputs, navigate to the [Quarto Task folder](https://shubhgaur37.github.io/UCD-Autumn-Data-Programming-With-R/Quarto-Task).

### Assignment 1
This assignment focuses on introductory data manipulation and analysis techniques using R.

- **Files**:
  - `Assignment_1.qmd`: Detailed Quarto markdown file with R code.
  - `Assignment_1.html`: Rendered HTML document displaying all code and outputs.

For more information, visit the [Assignment 1 folder](https://shubhgaur37.github.io/UCD-Autumn-Data-Programming-With-R/Assignment-1).

### Assignment 2
Building on the foundations set by the first assignment, this involves more complex data tasks and deeper analysis.

- **Files**:
  - `Assignment_2.qmd`: Quarto markdown file for this assignment.
  - `Assignment_2.html`: Rendered HTML output document.

Check out the [Assignment 2 folder](https://shubhgaur37.github.io/UCD-Autumn-Data-Programming-With-R/Assignment-2) for detailed questions and solutions.

### Final Project
The Final Project is a comprehensive application of all the techniques learned throughout the course, focusing on a specific dataset and set of objectives.

- **Files**:
  - `Final_Project.qmd`: Comprehensive Quarto markdown file.
  - `Final_Project.html`: Rendered HTML document of the project.
